Here's a formatted release note for the "Colorizer" project:

---

## Release: Colorizer

### Presentation

Colorizer is an Android Studio project designed to bring color to black-and-white images. While the resulting colors may not always perfectly reflect reality, this unpredictability adds to the fun!

The app utilizes a neural network to infer colors, relying on the OpenCV library and native C++ code integrated via the Android JNI framework.

**OpenCV Library**  
The OpenCV library is essential for the app's functionality and can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).

### Compilation Instructions

To compile the Colorizer app, follow these steps to include the OpenCV4 native shared libraries:

1. Clone the OpenCV repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv
   ```

2. Inside the OpenCV directory, create a build folder and navigate to it:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

3. For each Android architecture (e.g., `x86`, `armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`), run the following command to generate the Makefile:
   ```bash
   cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DINSTALL_ANDROID_EXAMPLES=ON -DANDROID_EXAMPLES_WITH_LIBS=ON -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DBUILD_DOCS=OFF -DWITH_OPENCL=OFF -DWITH_IPP=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${ANDROID_NDK}/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake -DANDROID_TOOLCHAIN=clang "-DANDROID_STL=c++_shared" -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a -DANDROID_SDK_TARGET=18 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python2.7 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython2.7.so.1.0 -DBUILD_JAVA=OFF -DBUILD_ANDROID_EXAMPLES=OFF ../
   ```

4. Build the shared libraries for each architecture:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

5. Copy the resulting shared library files into the `app/src/main/libs` directory within the Colorizer project.

6. Update the `android.mk` file in the Colorizer project to reference the appropriate OpenCV includes and shared library paths.

After completing these steps, youâ€™ll be ready to build and run Colorizer in Android Studio.
